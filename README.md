# INTRODUCTION
This is my repository where I will publish my Advanced Programming Techniques (Java) Practices. It works like an online product library.

# CODE
The code consists of:
- Classes: Main, Menus, Products (Movies and Books), User, MyException, SimpleSearch, MathDiscount and ShoppingCart. It also has an Internationalization class to change the language (English or Spanish).
- Tests: BooksTest, MoviesTest, UserTest and SimpleSearchTest.
- Interfaces: InterfaceProducts and Search.

# MAIN
If you run the program, a menu will appear on the console with five options: Log in, create, delete and shows users, and change the language. If you log in propertly, another menu will appear, this time with the products options, where you can search, borrow or return them. The products will be saved in a shopping cart and you will be able to apply a discount before logging out.  

Why sometimes we have to stop the development? This is to improve the interface or refactoring the code, due to make a simpler program for the user, improving it both visually and in time of execution, to do it more quickly.

That's all for now!
