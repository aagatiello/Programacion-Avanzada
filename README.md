# INTRODUCTION
This is my repository where I will publish my Advanced Programming Techniques (Java) Practices.
At the moment the program is very simple, it works like an online library.

# CODE
The code consists of three classes: User, Book and Main. It also contains a Testbook.

# MAIN
If you run the program, a small menu will appear on the console with four options, two related to the user and two related to the books. By choosing their respective numbers, you can create or delete a user, and borrow or return a book.



That's all for now!
